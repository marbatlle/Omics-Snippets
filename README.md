# Overview of the case study: Exome Analysis (OVCA)

**Goal:** Create a pipeline for the variant analysis of Whole-Exome Sequencing data.

**Data:** Whole-exome sequencing data from two samples from the patient (data was modified to reduce the computational analysis time), including:
* Human Genome: Alignment on a consensus genome reference
* Intervals: Predefined genomic regions of interest
* Raw Data: Patient's sample data, generated by the sequencing machine
    * Tumor sample
    * Matched normal sample (healthy tissue) from epithelium



**Library protocol:** Agilent SureSelect V5 Human All Exons.
